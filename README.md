Code used for computing eigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on M/Gamma. 

Debugs file contains old code used to debug the code avaialable in the /utils and / directories.
/utils contains the necessary functions to carry out the program. We have code relating to the construction of the dirchlet domain, the necessary geometry, special functions and matrix generation. 

The parameter_control.py file still requires further examination, i.e. we still aren't sure if the implemented method of controlling the certain parameters in the paper have been implemented in a satisfactory manner.
